This is a `CircuitBreaker` class that has the following methods:

1. Fire: To make requests
2. Success: Triggered on success
3. Fail: Triggered on a failure

The core idea is simple, letâ€™s understand it with the help of a flowchart:

We start with a Closed state, meaning requests are going through. If the number of failures is more than a failureThreshold, the circuit shifts into the Open state, meaning no more requests can go through.
